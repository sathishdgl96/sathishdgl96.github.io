<title>Role of timestamp</title>
</head><body><b>Time Keeping:<br/>
</b> =&gt; Synchronization of time could not be same (Hacker may change time on his system)<br/>
<br/>
Check the data and logs =&gt; Timestamp should be matched<br/>
NTP- Network time protocol [This gives us time synchronization]<br/>
NIST - National institute of standards and technology<br/>
<br/>
Every country has time standarization, NTP protocols can synchronize clock in milliseconds<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TCP/IP also provides timestamp and ICMP also provides timestamp<br/>
[Not suitable for accurate time keeping]<br/>
<br/>
NTP =&gt; Time moves only forward and backward is not allowed, and do outlier analysis<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with growing amount of data, all the insititution who work on diigital forensics should be equipped<br/>

Reconstructing past events:<br/>
<br/>
</b>crimes increases =&gt;tools needs upgradation (s/w and h/w)=&gt; tools are available<b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
How to reconstruct past events:<br/>
</b>=&gt; to verify your evidences<br/>
=&gt; file can be in usuable file or unusable file format<b><br/>
</b><b>    1. </b>usuable file can be directly given for analysis<br/>
    2. If the format is unknown or new, you need to convert it to the usuable format<br/>
=&gt;You need the support from organization and software to support the conversion<br/>
